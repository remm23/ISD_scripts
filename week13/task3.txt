a. What’s a class?
    In object-oriented programming
    a class is a template for the method's and properties for 
    a particular kind of object.

b. What’s an instance?
    An instance or an object is the creation of the class when initialised

c. What’s the relationship between a class and an instance?
    the class definds what properties and methods the instance will have
    before it is instantiated into an object

d. What’s the Python syntax used for defining a new class?
    the "class" keyword is used to define a new class

e. What’s the spelling convention for a class name?
    the spelling convention for a class name is to capitalize the first letter

f. How do you instantiate, or create an instance of, a class?
    a class instance is created by assining the class to a variable and initializing it with parenthesis

g. How do you access the attributes and behaviors of a class instance?
    once an class has been instantiated, the properties and methods can be accesed by dot notation,
    for example: 
    print(a.name) # this will print the name property of a

h. What’s a method?
    a method is exactly like a function but it is part of a class

i. What’s the purpose of self?
    the purpose of self is to reffer to the peoperties of the class itself

j. What’s the purpose of the __init__ method?
    the __init__ method is called once the class has been instantiated. 
    It initalizes all the properties in a class

k. Describe how inheritance helps prevent code duplication.
    inheritance helps prevent code duplication by allowing sub classes to use properties and methods from super classes
